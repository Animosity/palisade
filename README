This will be the site of my latest projects.

MusicService plugin coming soon.

BE PATIENT! This plugin has some hardcoded file paths that I need to get rid of before it can be used on other servers. I'm going to be pulling paths from a config.yml instead that will allow server admins to set the locations. As such, there is no code or jar available yet.

All of the major known bugs have been stomped, so we'll be putting out a release shortly as soon as I make those last fixes. I'm at my job right now so I won't be able to update it until I get home tonight.
